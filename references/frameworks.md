# Pitch Deck Review Frameworks

## The ABC Framework (Deck Rooster)

Every pitch deck tells a story of transformation from A to C, with B as the catalyst.

- **Point A (Current State)**: Where the company is today — proven traction, de-risked elements, what's real and functional.
- **Point B (Inflection Point)**: What this fundraising round will unlock — specific capabilities or milestones the capital enables. Creates urgency.
- **Point C (Future Vision)**: The long-term potential and market opportunity the company is building toward.

### Core investor question
"Can this team move from A to C, and what risks remain?"

### The investment decision
Investors "lean in" when:
1. The journey from A to C feels **clear, credible, and inevitable**
2. The valuation (price at B) sits **meaningfully below** what C represents — creating asymmetric return potential

### How to evaluate each slide
Every slide in the deck should serve one (or both) of these purposes:
- **Reduce risk** — Make the A→C journey feel more credible and inevitable (de-risk execution, market, team, or insight)
- **Increase the value of C** — Make the future outcome feel larger, more defensible, or more valuable (increases pricing/valuation justification)

A slide that does neither is wasted space. A great slide does both.

## The Inevitable Story Framework (Deck Rooster)

### 4 Layers of Investor Conviction

| Layer | Core Question |
|-------|--------------|
| **MARKET** | Is this problem real, big, and growing? |
| **INSIGHT** | Does this founder see something others don't? |
| **FOUNDER** | Is this person unreasonably committed? |
| **EXECUTION** | Can this team actually deliver? |

### 7 Blocks (the narrative arc)

#### Block 1: The World Has Changed [MARKET]
*"A shift has created a new opening..."*
What specific change has created a new reality? A dated, concrete shift.

#### Block 2: This Creates a Painful Gap [MARKET]
*"Because of that, these people are struggling..."*
Who is suffering, how often, and what is it costing them? Use their language.

#### Block 3: Current Solutions Fail Because... [INSIGHT]
*"Existing options can't solve this structurally..."*
The architectural, incentive, or model-level reason incumbents are stuck.

#### Block 4: I Know Something Others Don't, Because... [INSIGHT + FOUNDER]
*"Through my experience, I've learned that..."*
Your earned secret tied to why YOU see it. Insight + founder story inseparable.

#### Block 5: So We Built... [EXECUTION]
*"Which led us to build..."*
The product should feel like the only logical response to Blocks 1–4.

#### Block 6: We're the Team Making It Work, Because... [EXECUTION]
*"Here's the evidence and the people behind it..."*
Traction + why this team is uniquely equipped. Team unfair advantages.

#### Block 7: This Gets Enormous Because... [MARKET]
*"Here's how this compounds into something massive..."*
The wedge, expansion, and why economics improve over time.

## Mapping Blocks to ABC + Risk/Value

| Block | ABC Phase | Risk Reduced | Value of C Increased |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1. World Has Changed | Sets up C | Market risk (is this real?) | Yes — larger inevitable wave |
| 2. Painful Gap | Sets up C | Market risk (do people care?) | Yes — quantifies pain = willingness to pay |
| 3. Solutions Fail | Strengthens A→C path | Competitive risk (will incumbents win?) | Yes — structural moat |
| 4. Earned Secret | Strengthens A→C path | Insight risk (is this the right approach?) | Yes — differentiated positioning |
| 5. So We Built | Demonstrates A | Execution risk (can they build?) | Depends on product strength |
| 6. Team + Traction | Demonstrates A | Team/execution risk | Yes — traction validates C |
| 7. Gets Enormous | Defines C | Scale risk (is C big enough?) | Directly expands C |
