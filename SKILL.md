description: Review and critique VC pitch decks using the ABC Framework and Inevitable Story Framework from Deck Rooster. Use when a user shares a pitch deck (PDF, images, slides) and wants feedback on their fundraising narrative, slide structure, or investor readiness. Also use when a user asks for help improving, restructuring, or evaluating a startup pitch deck for VC fundraising.

# Pitch Deck Reviewer

Review pitch decks through the lens of two complementary frameworks. Read [references/frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) before starting any review.

## Review Workflow

1. **Read the deck** — Go through every slide, extracting the core message of each.
2. **Map slides to the 7 Blocks** — Identify which Block(s) each slide addresses. Flag slides that don't map to any Block.
3. **Evaluate each slide on the ABC dual test**:
   - Does this slide **reduce risk** for the investor (making A→C more credible)?
   - Does this slide **increase the value of C** (making the outcome bigger/more defensible)?
   - Rate each: Strong / Weak / Missing
4. **Assess the 4 Conviction Layers** — For each layer (Market, Insight, Founder, Execution), rate how well the deck builds conviction: Strong / Needs Work / Missing.
5. **Check narrative flow** — Do the slides follow the Inevitable Story arc (Blocks 1→7)? Flag breaks in logic or missing narrative bridges.
6. **Produce the review output.**

## Review Output Format

### Slide-by-Slide Analysis

For each slide:

> **Slide N: [Slide Title/Topic]**
> - **Block**: [Which of the 7 Blocks this maps to, or "None — consider removing/reworking"]
> - **Conviction Layer**: [MARKET / INSIGHT / FOUNDER / EXECUTION]
> - **Reduces Risk?** [What specific risk it reduces, or "No — here's why"]
> - **Increases Value of C?** [How it expands the future outcome, or "No — here's why"]
> - **Verdict**: [Strong / Needs Work / Weak]
> - **Suggestion**: [One concrete improvement if needed]

### Narrative Arc Assessment

Evaluate how well the deck follows the 7-Block sequence. Identify:
- Missing blocks (gaps in the story)
- Out-of-order blocks (narrative confusion)
- Blocks that are present but unconvincing

### Conviction Layer Scorecard

| Layer | Rating | Key Gap |
|-------|--------|---------|
| MARKET | Strong / Needs Work / Missing | [Specific gap] |
| INSIGHT | Strong / Needs Work / Missing | [Specific gap] |
| FOUNDER | Strong / Needs Work / Missing | [Specific gap] |
| EXECUTION | Strong / Needs Work / Missing | [Specific gap] |

### ABC Framework Summary

- **Point A (Current State)**: [How well the deck establishes where they are today]
- **Point C (Future Vision)**: [How compelling and large C feels]
- **A→C Journey**: [Does it feel clear, credible, and inevitable?]
- **Valuation Gap**: [Does the current stage (A) suggest the price is meaningfully below C?]

### Top 3 Improvements

Prioritized, actionable changes that would most improve investor conviction.

## Evaluation Principles

- A slide that neither reduces risk nor increases C is wasted space — flag it.
- The strongest slides do both simultaneously.
- Block 4 (Earned Secret) is the hardest to nail and the most differentiated — pay extra attention.
- Traction (Block 6) is the single most powerful risk-reducer — if present, evaluate how well it's presented.
- The deck should make the A→C journey feel **inevitable**, not just possible.
